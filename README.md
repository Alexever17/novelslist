## Description

This is an ongoing project with multiple purposes in mind.<br/>
First of all I would like to create an easy, digital repository to save the informaitons of all the books I read and also maintain their progress easily with cross platform tools. <br/>
Secondly, this functions as a project to learn vue.js, a major frontend library. To learn more about it head to the Packages section. If possible this project will be constantly updated and will hopefully include access for users.
