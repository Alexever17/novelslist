# novelslist 


The third version of my website to showcase my favorit novels and books, this time with Vue.js

## Description

This is an ongoing project with multiple purposes in mind.
First of all I would like to create an easy, digital repository to save the 
informaitons of all the books I read and also maintain their progress easily with cross platform tools.
Secondly, this functions as a platform to learn vue.js, a makor frontend library. To learn more about it head below.
In generally if possible this project will be constantly updated and will hopefully include access for users.
