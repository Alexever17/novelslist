Not only was this trash ungifted in the literary arts and martial arts, but she was also big chested without a brain, arrogant, and self-willed. It was not enough for her to have a perfect fiancé like the Crown Prince. She actually forcibly snatched a pretty boy in public, leading to the Crown Prince to annul their engagement. However, the waste could not withstand this shock, so she actually hung herself to end her life. Opening her eyes again, she was no longer the previous useless eldest miss. With a contract with the Medical God's Code, the possession of a spiritual plant space, and miraculous hands that can bring the dead back to life, her medical skills will stun the world! Extending from the royals and nobles on top to the merchants and old and influential families below, they will all compete to curry her favor. Even His Highness the Crown Prince, who previously broke the engagement, came knocking on the door with a desire to reconcile? In regard to this, a certain mysterious man finally could not endure it anymore and proclaimed, “Whoever dares to come and harass my woman, let them come but never return!”",

The mythical beings will choose their summoners on their 14th birthday and give them a stigma. Schools have been set up to train summoners and magical swordsman (basically bodyguards that give the summoners time to cast their spell) as a result. 15 years later after the finding of magic Kazuki Hayashizaki is chosen as a summoner and given a stigma to indicate that. This is surprising since males aren’t chosen as summoners due to their low amount of mana compared to females. As the first male to be a summoner Kazuki is under a lot of scrutiny by almost everyone. To complicate matters his sister (who’s a magical swordsman) is against him going into summoner school to train there as a summoner. Because summoners and magical swordsman have a cat mouse thing going on where summoners look down on magical swordsman as inferior so his sister naturally is against him going there. She’ll stop him even if it means going to war. Kazuki however is determined to thrive in summoner school and has already determined to give it his all. Even if he’s the lowest ranked student (ranked E) and his fellow students intend to demean him he’ll prove himself as the strongest summoner.",

   "Description": "Just as a gamer found an overpowered skill book called ‘Item Upgrade’ in the hottest virtual reality role-playing game on Earth, something happened to the game’s system, causing his soul to leave his body and go to another dimension. Common sense dictates that he would be born anew then become the greatest overlord of this world by making use of his advanced knowledge. Not in this case! He was already dead. Only some fragments of his soul and that skill book managed to get into that dimension and merge with an ordinary common youngster called Bai Yunfei. This was the enormous Tianhun continent, where humans could be said to have no limits. There was a group of humans here who could cultivate the power of their own souls then control their bodies, the natural elements and even other people’s souls with that power! These special beings were called — soul cultivators. Come witness how the several fragments of the dead inter-dimensional traveler’s soul and that skill book, which was not governed by the laws of this plane, were going to help Bai Yunfei become a legendary soul cultivator and craftsman!",

Yet the interference of an unknown event during the casting of his spell led him to be thrown through space and time. Where status screens were accepted as normal and class distinctions were quite clear. Leveling and achieving a class beyond a simple farmer or peddler was an affair of life and death combined with years of hard training. Goblins were not the fodder that they should be, orcs filled bedtime stories in order to scare children into behaving, and a dragon? You might as well pack up and move to another country. He, however, enters this world with the rare and powerful class of the Arcanist. How will the recently ardent seeker of magic find greater heights, or will he land in deeper depths?",

   "Description": "\"You're too arrogant.\"  To Dyon, it seemed as though these words were heard all the time.  However, how could these people possibly know of all his hard work? Of the fact that sleep was but a distant relative of his. How could they know that he never had a single moment to rest.  And yet, despite their ignorance, they still said, \"you're too arrogant...\"  But where were those people when a five-year-old Dyon's eyes shone looking at a computer screen filled with code? Where were those people when an eight-year-old Dyon played his piano and plucked his guitar strings until his fingers bled... needing to vent his feelings about his lost mother without bothering his fatigued father? Where were those people when Dyon sat alone at ten-years-old… when his parents were gone, and the only thing left was a room filled with inventions and computers?  Dyon's arrogance wasn't borne of thin air. It was his hard work. It was his shield. And he wasn't willing to give it up...  Now alone, he left his home behind.  He was no longer the boy genius who changed the human mortal realm. He was now nothing but a commoner, a bug noble families saw fit to step on. An insignificant existence.  And yet, Dyon was still the same unchanging person. Standing tall, his eyes firm and his will indomitable.  This so-called Martial World would come to understand the meaning behind his existence...",

   "Description": "Draco had risen to the top of the world through his exploits in the legendary FIVR game, Boundless. After years of intense conflicts between his guild, Hellscape and the guild of his former infidel lover, Darkrow, things came to a head when Draco conquered all. Now, nothing stood in his way of total conquest within the highly acclaimed second world of mankind, as he intended to fortify his new empire. Unfortunately, a timely assassination sent him back into the wheel of time for reincarnation, but not even the Gods gave him peace of death. Thrust into the past, Draco realized he'd been given a second chance at life to start from scratch, with all the knowledge of over fifteen years of almost absolute power in Boundless. Now, his path to glory will be far shorter and filled with more bloodshed than Hades could handle.",

   "Description": "You may now kiss the bride.\" But no kiss came, the warmth of her hand suddenly vanished. The feeling of standing on stable ground was switched to the stomach churning pain of free-falling. And then my consciousness was severed. I woke up on the cold hard dirt in the middle of a fantastical forest. I believe I'm not on Earth anymore. My clothes tell me I'm in a Renaissance Faire, but the sharpness of the sword in my waist tell me otherwise. An itch inside my brain leads me to open a \"menu\", a few squares float in the air like magic or an incredibly realistic VR, they are buttons. \"Status\", \"Skills\", \"Magic\", \"Items\", \"Notes\", and \"Messages\". There's an \"!\" on the corner of \"Messages\" so I immediately open it. Sender: God \"I'm sorry for this, but there's no way for you to go back.\" I feel my \"Sanity\" stat decreasing. Ripped away from the happiest moment of my life, I got stuck in a completely different world of swords and magic, alone. Monsters, hunters, dungeons, adventurers, levels, EXP, nobles, royalty, magic, slaves, gods, religion, sex and love, barely anything of my common sense seems to apply in this world. I will have to learn to how to live here, apparently I have much, much to learn.",
